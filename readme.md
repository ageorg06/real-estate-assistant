# Real Estate Assistant üè†

A real estate assistant application built with Streamlit and PHIdata that helps qualify leads and match properties through natural conversation. The application includes lead capture, appointment booking, and AI-powered property search features.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker (for database and workspace)
- OpenAI API key
- Google OAuth credentials (for authentication)
- PHIdata CLI([1](https://docs.phidata.com/cli/installation))

## Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd real-estate-assistant
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8501
PHI_API_KEY=your_phi_api_key  # Get from PHIdata dashboard
```

5. **Start the PHI workspace**
```bash
# Start development workspace
phi ws up

# To start production workspace
phi ws up prd
```

This command will:
- Start the PostgreSQL database with pgvector
- Run database migrations
- Start the Streamlit application
- Set up the development environment

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

6. **Stop the workspace**
```bash
phi ws down  # For development
phi ws down prd  # For production
```
